Project Name: WardrobeAI â€“ Clothing Image Classifier
Description:
Developed a web-based application that classifies clothing types from uploaded images using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Machine Learning Model.
Frontend: Built an interactive and user-friendly interface using React, enabling users to upload images and view predictions seamlessly.
Backend: Implemented a RESTful API using Flask to preprocess images, handle user requests, and communicate with the ML model for predictions.
Machine Learning: Trained and deployed a KNN classifier on the Fashion MNIST dataset to accurately identify clothing categories such as T-shirts, trousers, shoes, etc.
Technologies Used: React, Flask, Python, NumPy, Pandas, Git, and Git LFS for version control.
